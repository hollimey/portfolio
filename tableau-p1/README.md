## Analyzing the Impacts of Climate Change on Ocean Dynamics
The project sought to create an interactive dashboard that explores environmental data from NOAA's marine records and observations during 1960 to 2023. In doing so, we analyzed the impacts of climate change on ocean dynamics by addressing the following topics. Climate factors and marine species shifts, sea ice extent and melt season, and duration, severity, and regional impact of marine heat waves. <br/><br/>
