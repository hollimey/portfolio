## Analyzing the Impacts of Climate Change on Ocean Dynamics
The project sought to create an interactive dashboard that explores environmental data from NOAA's marine records and observations from 1960 to 2023. <br/>

The questions addressed include the following: <br/>
Topic 1: Climate Factors and Marine Species Shifts
- Which marine species appear to be most affected by sea level change?
- Which marine species have shown the most movement?
- Are there detectable changes to marine species migration patterns in the U.S.?
Topic 2: Examining Sea Ice Extent and Melt Season
- Does the extent of Arctic sea ice impact its melt season?
- What sea ice ages have seen the lowest ice extent at the end of their melt seasons in September?
- How has the duration of Arctic sea ice melt seasons between March and September evolved over the
years?
Topic 3: Duration, Severity, and Regional Impact of Marine Heat Waves
- How have severe marine heat wave events changed over time between different U.S. coastal regions?
- Which marine protected areas experienced the most intense marine heat wave impacts between 2018
and 2023?
- How has the duration of marine heat wave events evolved over time, and which severity levels are most
dominant across regions?
